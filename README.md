# Welcome to Project & Portfolio!

This repository will be used to keep track of _Project & Portfolio 1_ research and development conducted during class. Follow the **instructions** below to get started.

## Step 1

Review the [About](./docs/01_about/README.md) readme located in your docs folder.

## Step 2

Begin required research for the first milestone "Version Control" (see FSO).

## Step 3

Watch the following video: **[Milestone 1 - Version Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfYuBjGqHaY&feature=youtu.be)**.
<br>

### Next Step

After completing the above steps, begin to work on your assignments for the first milestone.

## Personal Refactoring / Coding Accomplishments

### Through research and practice, I have learned the basics of what refactoring code entails

##### By refactoring, I have learned to:

- Create a single validation class to use for entire projects<br>

- Create a user menu to select different programs and exit the program when finished<br>

<br>
### Recently learned code from research and refactoring
- Data can be declared and defined in the scope of the class allowing it to be called instead of sent from one function to another.
- Learning how to use DateTime and TimeSpan came in handy when needing to validate a date, and determining how much time has passed from one date to another.
- For the StringValidation method, I learned that I can pass a string as an argument as long as the method immediately uses the passed string, thus eliminating extra lines from main.
