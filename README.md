# Project & Portfolio II

This repository is for Web Development II course projects that contain newly learned JavaScript and HTML skills combined with my Visual Studio works.

## Current Research for Visual Studio

Right now, the biggest 'need-to-know' topic for me is how to use .Random().  Here is where I have been spending most of my time studying to understand how to use the function: **[MSDN Random Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=netframework-4.8)**

Here is a screenshot of how I've set it up my code to use the class:

## JavaScript / HTML Research

In my research and practice to far, JavaScript has been a lot less complicated than I originally thought it would be.  The only thing that slows me down is getting used using < and > for HTML and remembering that everything needs the closing tag as well.  I have transcribed six Visual Studio programs over to JavaScript that can be found here: **[C# - JavaScript](https://github.com/GAMetcalf/Greg_Metcalf_Portfolio/tree/master/JS%20Projects%201-6)**

Feel free to check out some of my other completed assignments!<br>
